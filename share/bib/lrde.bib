                  tools, powerful language-generic program-transformation
                  components are needed. We propose the use of attribute
                  grammars (AGs) to generate language specific
                  disambiguation filters. In this paper, a complete
                  implementation of a language-independent AGs system is
                  presented. As a full scale experiment, we present an
                  implementation of a flexible C front-end. Its
                  specifications are concise, modular, and the result is
                  efficient. On top of it, transformations such as software
                  renovation, code metrics, domain specific language
                  embedding can be implemented.},

                  debatable enterprise, since the industry will certainly
                  \emph{not} recruit them for this competence. Yet we made
                  that decision five years ago, for reasons not related to
                  compiler construction. We detail these motivations, the
                  resulting compiler design, and how we manage the
                  assignment. The project meets its goals, since the
                  majority of former students invariably refer to it as
                  \emph{the} project that taught them the most.},

                  design of such systems is the handling of the inherent
                  complexity of the nodes, strengthened by the huge number
                  of nodes in the network.  For these reasons, it becomes
                  very difficult to model and verify such systems.  In this
                  paper, we investigate the main characteristics of sensor
                  nodes, discuss about the use of a language derived from
                  Reactive Modules for their modeling and propose a language
                  (and a tool set) that ease the modeling of this kind of

  abstract =	 {The goal of model checking is to verify the correctness of
                  a given program, on all its inputs. The main obstacle, in
                  many cases, is the intractably large size of the program's
                  transition system. Property testing is a randomized method
                  to verify whether some fixed property holds on individual
                  inputs, by looking at a small random part of that
                  input. We join the strengths of both approaches by
                  introducing a new notion of probabilistic abstraction, and
                  by extending the framework of model checking to include
                  the use of these abstractions. Our abstractions map
                  transition systems associated with large graphs to small
                  transition systems associated with small random
                  subgraphs. This reduces the original transition system to
                  a family of small, even constant-size, transition
                  systems. We prove that with high probability,
                  ``sufficiently'' incorrect programs will be rejected
                  ($\eps$-robustness). We also prove that under a certain
                  condition (exactness), correct programs will never be
                  rejected (soundness). Our work applies to programs for
                  graph properties such as bipartiteness, $k$-colorability,
                  or any $\exists\forall$ first order graph properties. Our
                  main contribution is to show how to apply the ideas of
                  property testing to syntactic programs for such
                  properties. We give a concrete example of an abstraction
                  for a program for bipartiteness. Finally, we show that the
                  relaxation of the test alone does not yield transition
                  systems small enough to use the standard model checking
                  method. More specifically, we prove, using methods from
                  communication complexity, that the OBDD size remains
                  exponential for approximate bipartiteness.},

                  static execution of meta-programs and dynamic execution of

                  takes advantage of this dual execution model through the
                  construction of C++ types expressing simple arithmetic
                  formulas. Our intent is to extend this technique to a
                  whole programming language. The Tiger language is a small,
                  imperative language with types, variables, arrays,
                  records, ow control structures and nested functions. The
                  rst step is to show how to express a Tiger program as a
                  C++ type. The second step concerns operational analysis
                  which is done through the use of meta-programs. Finally an
                  implemen- tation of our Tiger evaluator is proposed. Our
                  technique goes much deeper than the Expression Templates
                  one. It shows how the generative power of C++
                  meta-programming can be used in order to compile abstract
                  syntax trees of a fully featured programming language.},

                  or even faster in some cases. In this paper, we explain
                  how to tune \textsc{Lisp} code for performance by
                  introducing the proper type declarations, using the
                  appropriate data structures and compiler information. We
                  also explain how efficiency is achieved by the
                  compilers. These techniques are applied to simple image
                  processing algorithms in order to demonstrate the
                  announced performance on pixel access and arithmetic
                  operations in both languages.}

  abstract =	 {Implementing binary methods in traditional object oriented
                  languages is difficult: numerous problems arise, such as
                  typing (covariance vs. contra-variance of the arguments),
                  polymorphism on multiple arguments (lack of multi-methods)
                  etc. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate how those
                  problems are either solved, or nonexistent in the Common
                  Lisp Object System (CLOS). Several solutions for different
                  levels of binary methods support in CLOS are proposed.
                  They mainly consist in re-programming a binary method
                  specific object system through the CLOS meta-object
                  protocol.}
