  abstract    = {We define a translation from an intermediate box language for pretty printing to \TeX. This translation can be used as a back-end for pretty printers in documentation tools for programming languages. The translation is formulated in an executable algebraic specification formalism. An important aspect of the translation is the transformation of boxes according to a set of equations. These equations preserve the text formatting semantics of boxes which is also defined algebraically. New in this approach is that algebraic transformations of box terms are used to circumvent the limitations of the typesetter.\par The \TeX\ generator, which translates the box language to \TeX\ code, is a component of documentation tools generated for the programming environments developed with the ASF+SDF meta-environment, but can also be used as a separate tool. As a case study, the construction of a typesetter for the process specification formalism PSF is shown.},

  abstract  = {An ambiguous context-free grammar defines a language in which some sentences have multiple interpretations. For conciseness, ambiguous context-free grammars are frequently used to define even completely unambiguous languages and numerous disambiguation methods exist for specifying which interpretation is the intended one for each sentence. The existing methods can be divided in `parser specific' methods that describe how some parsing technique deals with ambiguous sentences and `logical' methods that describe the intended interpretation without reference to a specific parsing technique. We propose a framework of {\em filters\/} to describe and compare a wide range of disambiguation problems in a parser-independent way. A filter is a function that selects from a set of parse trees (the canonical representation of the interpretations of a sentence) the intended trees. The framework enables us to define several general properties of disambiguation methods. The expressive power of filters is illustrated by several case studies. Finally, a start is made with the study of efficient implementation techniques for filters by exploiting the commutativity of parsing steps and filter steps for certain classes of filters.},

  abstract     = {Disambiguation methods for context-free grammars enable concise specification of programming languages by ambiguous grammars. A disambiguation filter is a function that selects a subset from a set of parse trees---the possible parse trees for an ambiguous sentence. The framework of filters provides a declarative description of disambiguation methods independent of parsing. Although filters can be implemented straightforwardly as functions that prune the parse forest produced by some generalized parser, this can be too inefficient for practical applications. In this paper the optimization of parsing schemata, a framework for high-level description of parsing algorithms, by disambiguation filters is considered in order to find efficient parsing algorithms for declaratively specified disambiguation methods. As a case study the optimization of the parsing schema of Earley's parsing algorithm by two filters is investigated. The main result is a technique for generation of efficient LR-like parsers for ambiguous grammars modulo priorities.},

The rigidity of these first-order structures enforces a choice between strongly typed structures with little genericity or generic operations over untyped structures. In two-level signatures the second level defines the algebra of types used at the first level. Two-level grammars are the grammatical counterpart of two-level signatures. This paper discusses the correspondence between context-free grammars and first-order signatures, the extension of these to two-level grammars and signatures and shows how two-level grammars can be used for polymorphic syntax definition and the problems there are for the usage of two-level grammars as signatures in algebraic specification formalisms.},

Starting with a small kernel, several features for syntax definition are designed orthogonally to each other. This provides a framework for constructing new formalisms by adapting and extending old ones. The formalism is developed with the algebraic specification formalism ASF+SDF. It provides the following features: lexical and context-free syntax, variables, disambiguation by priorities, regular expressions, character classes and modular definitions. New are the uniform treatment of lexical syntax, context-free syntax and variables, the treatment of regular expressions by normalization yielding abstract syntax without auxiliary sorts, regular expressions as result of productions and modules with hidden imports and renamings.},

The Stratego compiler is based on program transformation; it transforms a high-level Stratego specification via several intermediate representations to C. Several optimizations are performed on the intermediate representations. The compiler is bootstrapped, i.e., it is specified in Stratego itself. In this paper we give an overview of the Stratego compiler: architecture; issues in the compilation of strategies; some high-lights of the specification; and experience with using strategies for writing program transformations.},
